Nexus Repository Google Cloud Storage Blobstore
==============================

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers](https://badges.gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers.svg)](https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This project adds [Google Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) backed blobstores to Sonatype Nexus 
Repository 3.  It allows Nexus Repository to store the components and assets in Google Cloud instead of a
local filesystem.

Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

Go read [our contribution guidelines](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get a bit more familiar with how
we would like things to flow.

Requirements
------------

* [Apache Maven 3.3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* [Java 8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* Network access to https://repository.sonatype.org/content/groups/sonatype-public-grid

Also, there is a good amount of information available at [Bundle Development Overview](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Bundle+Development#BundleDevelopment-BundleDevelopmentOverview)

Building
--------

To build the project and generate the bundle use Maven

    mvn clean install

If everything checks out, the nexus-blobstore-s3 bundle  should be available in the `target` folder

Google Cloud Storage Authentication
-----------------------------------

Per the [Google Cloud documentation](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java#authentication):

1. [Generate a JSON Service Account key](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication?hl=en#service_accounts)
2. Store this file on the filesystem with appropriate permissions for the user running Nexus to read it.
3. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable for the user running Nexus:

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/my/key.json

```

Alternatively, if you have not set this environment variable, the blobstore configuration screen within the 
Nexus Repository Manager administrative user interface will allow you to specify the path to the file.

Installing
----------

See `install.sh`.  This copies the nexus-blobstore-google-cloud jar file to the
right place and updates the configuration files.  Use at your own
risk.

Alternatively, copy nexus-blobstore-google-cloud-*.jar and the Google Cloud bundle
jar into the nexus/deploy subdirectory.

Start the bundle from the Nexus Repository console:

```
bundle:list | grep nexus-blobstore-google-cloud
bundle:start <bundleNumber>
```

Configuration
-------------

Log in as admin and create a new blobstore, selecting 'Google Cloud Storage' as the type.

The Fine Print
--------------

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to Google Cloud support
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this plugin and the Nexus platform, we are glad to have you here!
